# Summary

- Highly Available and Highly Reliable Systems are Fault-Tolerant by design
- Fault tolerance is achieved by:
  - provisioning redundancy for every SPOF
    - hot/active
    - warm/passive
    - cold/backups
  - building automated mechanism to detect faults
  - building automated failover mechanism to recover from faults
    - failover of stateless components
    - failover of stateful components
- Stability patterns
  - clients:
    - timeouts
    - retries
    - circuit breaker
  - server
    - fail fast
    - shed load
    - back pressure
