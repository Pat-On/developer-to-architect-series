# Partial System Failures

- Network Failure - Lan, WAN, Load Balancer
- Machine Failure - CPU, Disk, Memory
- Software Failure - Process
- Disaster - Datacenter
- Operations
  - deployment failure
  - configuration failure
  - load induced failure
  - external service failure


After a point its much more economical to recover from a failure instead of preventing it altogether


- no matter how hard we try
  - Hardware and networks will fail
  - a changing software will fail
  - disaster will happen
