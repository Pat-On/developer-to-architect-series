# Performance VS Scalabilityu

## Fixed Load

- Performance
  - Low Latency
  - high throughput
    - concurrency
      - single machine - multi-threading
      - multi machine - multi threading + multi-processing = Distributed Processing
    - Capacity


## Variable Load
- Scalability
  - High Throughput
    - Ability of a system to increase its throughput by adding more hardware capacity
  - Both ways - Up and Down
